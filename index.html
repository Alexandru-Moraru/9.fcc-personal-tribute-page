    <p>Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima, popularly dubbed O Fenômeno ('The Phenomenon') and also nicknamed R9 is widely
      considered as one of the greatest players of all time. Ronaldo has been the influence for a generation of strikers
      that have followed. His individual accolades include being named FIFA World Player of the Year three times and
      winning two Ballon d'Or awards.</p>

      Ronaldo started his career at Cruzeiro and moved to PSV in 1994. He joined Barcelona in 1996 for a then world
      record transfer fee and at 20 years old, he was named the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year, making him the
      youngest recipient of the award. In 1997, Inter Milan broke the world record fee to sign Ronaldo, making him the
      first player since Diego Maradona to break the world transfer record twice. At 21, he received the 1997 Ballon
      d'Or and remains the youngest recipient of the award. By the age of 23, Ronaldo had scored over 200 goals for club
      and country. However, after a series of knee injuries and recuperation, he was inactive for almost three years.
      Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2002 and won the 2002–03 La Liga title. He had spells at AC Milan and Corinthians
      before retiring in 2011, having suffered further injuries.

      Ronaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals and is the third-highest goalscorer for his national
      team. At age 17, he was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup. At the 1998
      FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament after he helped Brazil reach the
      final, where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before kick-off. He won the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in a
      front three with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. He scored twice in the final and received the Golden Boot as the
      tournament's top goalscorer. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored his 15th World Cup goal, a tournament
      record at the time. He also won the 1997 Copa América, where he became the player of the tournament and the 1999
      Copa América, where he was the top goalscorer.
